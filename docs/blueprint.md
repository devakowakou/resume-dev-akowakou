# **App Name**: PortfolioVerse

## Core Features:

- Animated Hero Section: Create an engaging hero section with animated text, a subtext typing effect, and animated CTA buttons using Framer Motion.
- Project Showcase with Interactive Cards: Display projects in an interactive grid layout with hover effects, tech tags, and modal-based demo previews.
- Animated Page Transitions: Implement smooth page transitions with fade and slide animations between different sections of the portfolio.
- Experience Timeline: Showcase professional experience in a visually appealing timeline with animated lines and staggered item appearances.
- Contact Form with Email Integration: Implement a contact form that integrates with an email service (e.g., EmailJS or Netlify Functions) to send messages.
- Scroll Reveal Animations: Use scroll reveal animations to bring cards and sections to life with subtle slide-up and fade-in effects as they enter the viewport. The tool will use reasonable heuristics to stagger animations where needed to create the impression of depth and artistry.
- Automated image optimization: Optimize images using next/image. Prioritize above-the-fold content with `priority` prop; defer loading of other images until they are close to the viewport.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#4F46E5) to convey a sense of innovation and professionalism.
- Background color: Light gray (#F4F5F7), providing a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Cyan (#22D3EE) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions with a vibrant touch.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for an elegant, high-end feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for clear, modern readability.
- Use 'lucide-react' icons to provide a consistent and professional feel. Use SVG path animations for logo.
- Implement subtle parallax scrolling effect, micro-interactions on hover and focus, and animated transitions with Framer Motion. Use animation to signal transitions from one mode to the next.
